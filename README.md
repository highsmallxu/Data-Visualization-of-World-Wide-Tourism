# Data-Visualization-of-World-Wide-Tourism
Many data are available regarding world wide tourism: absolute number of outbound and inbound travellers per country and per year, amount of money spent in a country by foreign tourists, total amount of money spent in other countries by one country’s outbound tourists. To derive meaningful information by looking at the sheer numbers is challenging though, and only trivial conclusions can be deduced. In order to understand these numbers in a more meaningful and interesting way visualization is needed. InfoVis allows easily to make comparison between countries, to see the global and local trends in a set period of time. Furthermore visualization allows to study the correlation between tourism and economics indicator like the PPP∗.
